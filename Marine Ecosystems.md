Most Marine ecosystems depend on photosynthetic plankton, known as **Phytoplankton** these plankton are the main primary producer for the entire marine ecosystem.

Photosynthetic activity tends to be highest near coastlines, where nitrogen, phosphorous and other nutrients wash into the water from both water table percolation and runoff from human agriculture.

## Oceans
Oceans are separates into vertical zones. 

- littoral, or intertidal zones, are at the top, and are only underwater some of the time. Low tides expose these areas to air
- Pelagic zones are the water table. The epipelagic zone is the top level of the ocean where photosynthesis occurs
- below that are the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones
- The Abyssal zone(4000 meters) and the hadal zone(6000 meters) are the deepest layer
- The ocean bed has its own ecosystem, with crabs and intertidal vent communities
