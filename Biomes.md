# What Is a Biome?
A Large biological Community is a **Biome**

The conditions of this community, such as geology, climate, and weather can predict what  biome is likely to occur there

biodiersity is the number and variety of different biological organisms that live in a given area(biome)

The main factors that predict a biome are precipitation and temperature
### Example
Low precipitation and low temperature will form a tundra biome, while high temperature and high rainfall will form a tropical rainforest.

# Latitude and Longitude
Biomes occur with varying frequency based on their location on earth. Tropical zones exist closer to the equator, while tundras and boreal forest occur more frequently closer to the poles.

## Latitude
Temperature controlled biomes occur in latitudinal bands
boreal forest crosses canada and northern siberia
temperate forest lie between the poles and the equator(pennsylvania)
dry, arid climates exist at the boundary between temperate and tropical latitudes
tropics form a large band around the equator.
