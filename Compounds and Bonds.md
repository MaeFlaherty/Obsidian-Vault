Elements can combine together to form compounds. while a mixture of 2 elements does not have aaltered properties and can have any ratio of elements, a compound is composed of the two or more elements bonded together in fixed ratios(The Law of Definite Proportions). Compounds have different properties from their component elements. 

# Types Of Chemical Bonds
A chemical bond is the force that holds the atoms of a compound together. 
## Ionic Bonds
Atoms(metal and nonmetal)transfer electrons between them, forming a 3d lattice of anions and cations

Ionic Bonds **Do not Form Molecules**



## Covalent(Molecular) Bonds
Nonmetals **share** electrons in pairs, and stick together as molecules


## Metallic Bonds
Metal atoms share electrons in a network of electrostatic attraction.

like ionic bonds, Metallic Bonds do not form molecules

This gives metals a number of unique properties, like conductivity, ductility/malleability, and magnetism.

# Predicting charges in ionic compounds
Metals tend to form cations, while non-metals tend to form anions. these then combine in factors to form an ionic compound. 

for example, calcium will form a +2 cation, and chlorine will form a -1 anion, so they will combine to form the ionic compound $CaCl_2$.

# How do we Represent Chemical Bonds?
## Molecular Formula
### Ionic Compounds
even though ionic bonds dont form molecules, we can still represent the structures they create. the chemical formula of an ionic compound represents the ions ratio per structure to give a neutral structure overall. $$Na^+Cl^-$$
This is known as a formula unit

## Lewis Structures
you can represent a single element in a lewis structure by drawing a series of dots representing the atom's valence electrons around it.

since covalent bonds wish to form an octet by sharing electrons, you can also represent molecular compounds using the same lewis structures.

![[Lewis_Bond.excalidraw]]
Each bond(Dash) represents 2 shared valence electrons. Bonding like this allows oxygen to form an Octet, which is a preferred and stable structure, along with a duet which occurs mostly in helium. 

## The Octet Rule
When atoms form covalent bonds, they gravitate towards sharing electrons to form an Octet or a Duet, so that each atom has 8 valence electrons.

To do this, they will form single, double, or triple bonds. 

## Polyatomic Ions
Sometimes, to satisfy the octet rule, compounds can gain a charge. these compounds are known as polyatomic ions(not molecular compounds, as molecular compounds are neutral), and are usually unstable, though they can be stabilized in a solution in real life. for example, $H_3O$ does not satisfy the octet rule, as the oxygen would have 9 electrons

But, if you take one electron away, giving the compound a positive charge, it becomes more stable, not less, allowing it to exist in solution.
