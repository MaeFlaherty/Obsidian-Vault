Elements can combine together to form compounds. while a mixture of 2 elements does not have aaltered properties and can have any ratio of elements, a compound is composed of the two or more elements bonded together in fixed ratios(The Law of Definite Proportions). Compounds have different properties from their component elements. 

# Types Of Chemical Bonds
A chemical bond is the force that holds the atoms of a compound together. 
## Ionic Bonds
Atoms(metal and nonmetal)transfer electrons between them, forming a 3d lattice of anions and cations

Ionic Bonds **Do not Form Molecules**



## Covalent(Molecular) Bonds
Nonmetals **share** electrons in pairs, and stick together as molecules


## Metallic Bonds
Metal atoms share electrons in a network of electrostatic attraction.

like ionic bonds, Metallic Bonds do not form molecules

This gives metals a number of unique properties, like conductivity, ductility/malleability, and magnetism.

# How do we Represent Chemical Bonds?
## Molecular Formula
### Ionic Compounds
even though ionic bonds dont form molecules, we can still represent the structures they create. the chemical formula of an ionic compound represents the ions ratio per structure to give a neutral structure overall. $$Na^+Cl^-$$
This is known as a formula unit

## Structural formula


## Ball and stick
