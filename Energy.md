## Wavelengths and Frequencies
Electromagnetic Radiation is a form of energy transport. Electromagnetic radiation takes the form of a sinusoidal wave. The electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other, and travel together at the same time.

The length between peaks of the wave is known as the wavelength, and can be used to measure the energy of that wave. The wavelength is represented by the character lambda: $\lambda$

The number of complete cycles per unit of time is called the wave's frequency. This is commonly measured in Hz, or the number of times something occurs in a single second. Frequency is represented as a variable by the greek letter nu: $\nu$
$$Hz =1/s=s^{-1}$$

### How does Wavelength Correlate With Frequency?
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional.A shorter wavelength means more complete cycles per unit of time!

### What relationship do Frequency and Wavelength have with Speed?
A faster wave means that wave will have a greater frequency, and because wavelength and frequency are inversely related, a higher speed means a shorter wavelength. 

The speed of light is a constant, which can be modified by the density of the medium it travels through. 

$c=3*10^8$m/s

$$c=\nu\lambda$$
$c=$Speed of Light in a vacuum - constant for a given medium

**note that**: the speed of a wave will not change unless the material it travels through changes. 

Using this relationship, we can determine the wavelength of a wave given the frequency, or vice versa.

$\nu = c/\lambda$
$\lambda = c/\nu$

# Electromagnetic Spectrum

Humans can only see a small spectrum of all wavelengths of electromagnetic energy. Every color we can see exists within this band.

## How is Energy Transmitted Electromagnetically
Max Planck discovered that energy is quantized, or that it can only be transferred in certain amounts. a **Quantum** is the smallest unit of energy that can be transferred. 

For any Electromagnetic wave
