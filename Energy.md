# What Is Energy?
This is just as difficult a question as defining [[Matter]] If not more so. for now, lets focus on Light, a form of electromagnetic energy.

## The nature of Light 
Light, a form of electromagnetic radiation, 
Light can be represented in 2 different ways, either as a wave or as a particle. Neither of these are perfect analogies for the actual natural phenomenon, but through years of experimentation and testing, they map on to the behavior of light well enough to allow us to understand the natural world better. Importantly, light **cannot be observed as, or thought of, as a wave or a particle at the same time**.
## Light as a Wave
When we think of light as a wave, there are 2 main characteristics to consider. the light's wavelength defines the **color** of that light, and the amplitude of the wave defines it's **brightness**.

#### What is The Speed of Light?
The speed of light is a constant, which can be modified by the density of the medium it travels through. 

Speed of light $=3*10^8$m/s
In equations, the speed of light is represented by the variable $c$.

$c=$Speed of Light in a vacuum - constant for a given medium

**note that**: the speed of a wave will not change unless the material it travels through changes. 
### Wavelengths and Frequencies
Electromagnetic Radiation is a form of energy made up of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic radiation takes the form of a sinusoidal wave. The electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other, and travel together at the same time

The length between peaks of the wave is known as the wavelength, and can be used to measure the energy of that wave. The wavelength is represented by the character lambda: $\lambda$

The number of complete cycles per unit of time is called the wave's frequency. This is commonly measured in Hz, or the number of times something occurs in a single second. Frequency is represented as a variable by the greek letter nu: $\nu$
$$Hz =1/s=s^{-1}$$

#### How does Wavelength Correlate With Frequency?
Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional.A shorter wavelength means more complete cycles per unit of time!

#### What relationship do Frequency, Wavelength, and Speed have?
A faster wave means that wave will have a greater frequency, and because wavelength and frequency are inversely related, a higher speed means a shorter wavelength. 
$$c=\nu\lambda$$
$c=$Speed of Light in a vacuum - constant for a given medium

Using this relationship, we can determine the wavelength of a wave given the frequency, or vice versa.

$\nu = c/\lambda$
$\lambda = c/\nu$

#### Visible Light Spectrum
Humans can only see a small spectrum of all wavelengths of electromagnetic energy. Every color we can see exists within a band of wavelengths from about 400 - 750(violet to red)

## How is Energy Transmitted Electromagnetically
Max Planck discovered that energy is quantized, or that it can only be transferred in certain amounts. a **Quantum** is the smallest unit of energy that can be transferred. 

For any Electromagnetic wave
### Light as a particle
before the 1900s, light was only thought of as a wave, but there were a few problems with this theory.
