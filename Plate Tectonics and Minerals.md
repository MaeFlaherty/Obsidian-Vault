#Geology
# Continental Drift
- Proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912
- observed that the edges of the continents lined up with each other, and based on that, theorized that the continents were once one enormous landmass. 
### Problems With Wegener's Hypothesis
- No Mechanism proposed for moving continents
- Wegener wasn't a geologist

# Magnetic inclination of the earth
The center of earth is made of iron, so earth has a magnetic field
Magnetic pole is about 10ยบ off spin axis of earth
this field wobbles and sometimes flips
This field acts on metals and ricks within the earth. For example, lava excites the magnetic dipoles within the rock, but as it cools, these dipoles will stop moving facing the direction of the field relative to their position.

We can date volcanic rocks and find where they were formed based on the orientation of these dipoles and what layer of rock it lies within.

Observing this leads us to believe that the continents are moving over time, as magnetic orientations are different in different layers of rock. We call this **Polar Wander**

# Marine Magnetic Anomalies
Observing a submarine volcanic ridge near iceland, we found evidence of the magnetic poles switching based on the age and polarity of the rocks at the center of the ridge vs off to the side
This also meant that the ridge was creating new rocks that formed and cooled
extending this idea gives us a new idea of how the continents were moving around. They had been forced apart at the mid ocean ridge!!

# Tectonic Plates
The earth is divided into a series of plates, bordered by volcanic ridges. 

### Divergent Plates
- The plates move away from each other, leaving a gap between them.

**Mid-Ocean Ridges**
when 2 oceanic plates diverge, magma flows up from the surface to form new crust, filling the gap. the polarity of this new crust aligns with the current magnetic field of the earth, giving us information about the age of the earth and when the magnetic field has flipped in the past. 

**Rifts**
a divergent rift is where 2 continental plates pull apart from each other.  somaliland and the rest of the African continent. This will eventually cause somaliland to break off, and form a new ocean between the 2 land masses.

### Convergent Plates
- the plates move towards each other, crashing into each other. the denser crust will go under the less dense crust(continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust) and fall into the mantle, dragging the rest of the plate forward with it. 

**oceanic subduction**
when 2 oceanic plates converge, the older, denser plate is subducted into the earth's core. This forms an oceanic trench, and sometimes a volcanic island chain. 

**oceanic-continental Subduction**
oceanic plate goes under continental plate, and is recycled into the mantle. a trench is formed off the continent

**Continental Collision** 
When 2 continental plates collide, they crash into each other and form a mountain range. The Indian subcontinent is currently still crashing into asia, causing a massive mountain range. 
### Transform Plates
- The plates move and rub alongside each other. 
**Transform Fault**



# Atoms, Elements, and Minerals

## Chemical Bonds
Atoms will give up or ggain an extra electron to have a stable outer ring. this creates 
Cations(+)
Anions(-)

### Ionic Bonds
the atoms are attracted to each other, when one is negatively charged and one is positively charged
### Covalent Bonds
The atoms share electrons, forming a very strong and stable bonded structure
#### Example
Si and O forms silicate minerals, the most common type of mineral on earth. 

### Metallic Bonds
the electrons are bonded together with electrons still free-flowing, allowing a for a stable but malleable substance. gold or steel working uses these properties.

## What is a Mineral?
- Naturally Occurring (Must be found in nature)
- Solid at room temperature(Except for Ice)
- Abiogenic(Not made **only** by living organisms) - many minerals **can** be biogenic, but that is not their only source. 
- Definite Chemical Composition - All specimens share the same physical and chemical properties. 
- Crystalline Structure - a solid and symmetrical atomic order(solids without this structure can be glasses, resins, or plastics)

## Identifying Minerals

### Crystal Habit
- arrangement of faces reflects internal atomic structure
- if a crystal forms unrestricted, it develops natural crystal faces and assumes a distinct geometric form
	Habits include asbestiform(needle-like), cubic, bladed, and others
### Cleavage or Fracture
how a mineral breaks can help identify a mineral
minerals will be weaker along certain planes, due to how their crystalline bonds form. This is known as the **Cleavage Plane**

Some minerals have no cleavage planes, and when they break, they will instead fracture. these fractures can be conchoidal, irregular, or crystalline.
### Specific gravity
represents the density of a mineral because minerals share the same chemical properties, their density can help you differentiate them. 
### Hardness
hardness is the scratching resistance of a mineral, which derives from the strength of atomic bonds. this is commonly measured using the mohs hardness scale. 

1. Talc, graphite
2. gypsum 
3. calcite 
4. flourite
5. apatite
6. orthoclase
7. quartz
8. topaz
9. corundum
10. diamond


### Luster 
The way a mineral scatters light on it's surface. 

luster can be **metallic** or **nonmetallic**

nonmetallic types
- Silky
- Vitreous
- Satiny
- resinous
- Pearly
- Earthy 
- Adamantine(diamond)
### Color 
color varieties can reflect trace impurities, but is diagnostic for some minerals
### Streak 
The color of powder when crushing a mineral. 

streak is collected by scraping the mineral on unglazed porcelain.
### Special Properties
Some minerals have unique chemical properties, such as smell, reaction to acid, magnetism, taste, feel, fluorescence
### Synthetic Minerals
Humans can recreate minerals that occur in nature, known as synthetic minerals, like in a diamond anvil press, used to recreate the conditions in the earth's mantle.

## Mineral Nomenclature
Minerals can be separated by
1. the principle anion
2. anionic group
actual mineral structures are dependent on sizes of ions
only about 50 minerals are abundant.

- hematite 
- rutile

### Sulfides
Metal cations bonded to a sulfide anion
- pyrite
- galena
- sphalerite
### Sulfates
Metal Cation bonded to sulfate anionic group
form by evapooration of seawater
