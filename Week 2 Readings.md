# Are You an Environmentalist or do you Work For a Living?

## Themes/Observations

- Conflict Between Outdoor Labor and Environmentalism
- Conflation of Labor with Destruction
- To Work in Nature is a form of Knowing it
- Work vs Play in Nature
- Environmentalists are typically aligned against work and for play(Play saved my life)
- We try to emulate working outdoors by making play more extreme(Free solo Rock Climbing, Whitewater rafting, long haul backpacking, etc) Again, work as a form of knowing, and knowing being the end goal of work and play.
- technology as an extension of man, also to further the knowing of nature(also including much maligned machines)
- Idealization of pristine, "untouched" nature being a side effect the "first white man" in north america/creation myth.
- "the labor of the body revealed that nature was cold, muddy, sharp, tenacious, slippery"
- Farmer No longer appears on the US census!?!
- Working is a way of preserving knowledge of the land
- "He was so wedded to a particular place that to move him would be to change who and what he was "
- working communicates a history of past work; this history is turned into a bodily practice until it seems but second nature(that one mexican guy roofing really fast while singing)
- Machines and the feminization of work(cunty combine harvester)
- Nature defining manhood
- Machines associated with women broke a male connection with female nature, thus creating an almost domestic drama
- Older, Peasant/Masculine labor was not nessecarily better for the environment. 
- "A connection with the land through work creates knowledge, but it does not necessarily grant protection to the land itself"
- condemning all work marks environmentalists as a privileged leisure class, glorifying archaic work marks them as reactionaries. 
- "sometimes work is destructive and restorative at the same time, as when we cut or burn a meadow to prevent the encroachment of forest"
- rejection of technology is not a solution to modern environmental problems.
- his office and the mountain view are separate parts of his life; They are not connected. In the office he is in control, outside he is not.
- "My body, the nature in me, would rebel... I do not face what I alter, and so I do not learn from it"
- Work, then, is where we should begin

## Thoughts
- Not all forms of work are equal in terms of destruction/benefit to the environment(The result of the labor matters)
- Play is arguably just as important, and a valid way to know nature, even if it is overemphasized
- Read river of traps
- Modern environmentalists, like most people today, are alienated from the land as a by product of capitalism. This alienation is typically solved through play, creating the lack of respect for outdoor labor because of a lack of knowledge of it(it's hard to recognize how working outdoors makes you feel if you work in a climate controlled, sterile starbucks all day) This connects to the idea of the office and the mountains being divorced from each other, but a typical worker is not in control in either location.
