# Are You an Environmentalist or do you Work For a Living?

## Themes/Observations

- Conflict Between Outdoor Labor and Environmentalism
- Conflation of Labor with Destruction
- To Work in Nature is a form of Knowing it
- Work vs Play in Nature
- Environmentalists are typically aligned against work and for play(Play saved my life)
- We try to emulate working outdoors by making play more extreme(Free solo Rock Climbing, Whitewater rafting, long haul backpacking, etc) Again, work as a form of knowing, and knowing being the end goal of work and play.
- technology as an extension of man, also to further the knowing of nature(also including much maligned machines)
- Idealization of pristine, "untouched" nature being a side effect the "first white man" in north america/creation myth.
- "the labor of the body revealed that nature was cold, muddy, sharp, tenacious, slippery"

## Thoughts
- Not all forms of work are equal in terms of destruction/benefit to the environment(The result of the labor matters)
- Play is arguably just as important, and a valid way to know nature, even if it is overemphasized
