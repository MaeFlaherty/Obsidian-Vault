# Are You an Environmentalist or do you Work For a Living?, William Cronon

## Themes/Observations

- Conflict Between Outdoor Labor and Environmentalism
- Conflation of Labor with Destruction
- To Work in Nature is a form of Knowing it
- Work vs Play in Nature
- Environmentalists are typically aligned against work and for play(Play saved my life)
- We try to emulate working outdoors by making play more extreme(Free solo Rock Climbing, Whitewater rafting, long haul backpacking, etc) Again, work as a form of knowing, and knowing being the end goal of work and play.
- technology as an extension of man, also to further the knowing of nature(also including much maligned machines)
- Idealization of pristine, "untouched" nature being a side effect the "first white man" in north america/creation myth.
- "the labor of the body revealed that nature was cold, muddy, sharp, tenacious, slippery"
- Farmer No longer appears on the US census!?!
- Working is a way of preserving knowledge of the land
- "He was so wedded to a particular place that to move him would be to change who and what he was "
- working communicates a history of past work; this history is turned into a bodily practice until it seems but second nature(that one mexican guy roofing really fast while singing)
- Machines and the feminization of work(cunty combine harvester)
- Nature defining manhood
- Machines associated with women broke a male connection with female nature, thus creating an almost domestic drama
- Older, Peasant/Masculine labor was not nessecarily better for the environment. 
- "A connection with the land through work creates knowledge, but it does not necessarily grant protection to the land itself"
- condemning all work marks environmentalists as a privileged leisure class, glorifying archaic work marks them as reactionaries. 
- "sometimes work is destructive and restorative at the same time, as when we cut or burn a meadow to prevent the encroachment of forest"
- rejection of technology is not a solution to modern environmental problems.
- his office and the mountain view are separate parts of his life; They are not connected. In the office he is in control, outside he is not.
- "My body, the nature in me, would rebel... I do not face what I alter, and so I do not learn from it"
- Work, then, is where we should begin

## Thoughts
- Not all forms of work are equal in terms of destruction/benefit to the environment(The result of the labor matters)
- Play is arguably just as important, and a valid way to know nature, even if it is overemphasized
- Read river of traps
- Modern environmentalists, like most people today, are alienated from the land as a by product of capitalism. This alienation is typically solved through play, creating the lack of respect for outdoor labor because of a lack of knowledge of it(it's hard to recognize how working outdoors makes you feel if you work in a climate controlled, sterile starbucks all day) This connects to the idea of the office and the mountains being divorced from each other, but a typical worker is not in control in either location.

# The Trouble With Wilderness, William Cronon

## Themes/Observations
- "For many Americans wilderness stands as the last remaining place where civilization, that all too human disease, has not fully infected the earth. It is an island in the polluted sea of urban-industrial modernity, the one place we can turn for escape from our own too-muchness. Seen in this way, wilderness presents itself as the best antidote to our human selves, a refuge we must somehow recover if we hope to save the planet. As Henry David Thoreau once famously declared, “In Wildness is the preservation of the World.” "
- The idea of wilderness is a product of civilization
- "we too easily imagine that what we behold is Nature when in fact we see the reflection of our own unexamined longings and desires"
- Sense of place is largely imagined, wilderness or otherwise (Perceived rurality  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q_BE5KPp18)
- Wilderness isnt quite nature, in the bible it was used to refer to places on the edge of civilization
- Because it is an imagined place, the definition of wilderness is constantly changing based on our collective cultural perception of the natural world in opposition to civilization.
- The wilderness was where Christ had struggled with the devil and endured his temptations: “And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. And he was there in the wilderness for forty days tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.” (5) The “delicious Paradise” of John Milton’s Eden was surrounded by “a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides /Access denied” to all who sought entry.” When Adam and Eve were driven from that garden, the world they entered was a wilderness that only their labor and pain could redeem. Wilderness, in short, was a place to which one came only against one’s will, and always in fear and trembling ... In its raw state, it had little or nothing to offer civilized men and women."
- "But by the end of the nineteenth century, all this had changed. The wastelands that had once seemed worthless had for some people come to seem almost beyond price. That Thoreau in 1862 could declare wildness to be the preservation of the world suggests the sea change that was going on. Wilderness had once been the antithesis of all that was orderly and good—it had been the darkness, one might say, on the far side of the garden wall—and yet now it was frequently likened to Eden itself"
- Changing of wilderness portrayed as improvement vs vandalism, changed in the twentieth century
- "Indeed, it is not too much to say that the modern environmental movement is itself a grandchild of romanticism and post-frontier ideology, which is why it is no accident that so Cronon, Trouble with Wilderness, Page 4 much environmentalist discourse takes its bearings from the wilderness these intellectual movements helped create."
- In the wilderness the boundaries between human and nonhuman, between natural and supernatural, had always seemed less certain than elsewhere.
- WIlderness in its current form, is still an imagined place, especially within national parks(What landscapes are selected shapes our idea of wilderness and what landscapes are worthy of that title) Wilderness as a definition is more a product of human emotion than nature.
- "Where were these sublime places? The eighteenth century catalog of their locations feels very familiar, for we still see and value landscapes as it taught us to do. God was on the mountaintop, in the chasm, in the waterfall, in the thundercloud, in the rainbow, in the sunset. One has only to think of the sites that Americans chose for their first national parks—Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Rainier, Zion—to realize that virtually all of them fit one or more of these categories. Less sublime landscapes simply did not appear worthy of such protection; not until the 1940s, for instance, would the first swamp be honored, in Everglades National Park, and to this day there is no national park in the grasslands. (13)"
- We feel most connected to wilderness when we can compare ourselves to a dramatic landscape, and feel insignifigant in the face of it. Wilderness as a spiritual experience. 
- "In effect, romantics like Thoreau joined Moses and the children of Israel in Exodus when “they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.” (16)"
- Thinking of wilderness in this way leads to drawing a line between "nature" and "civilization", even when such a line doesn't really exist.
- The romantics established the idea of The Mountain As The Cathedral
- This combined with primitivism to create the modern idea of wilderness.
- "Natural" as an idealized concept
- The frontier is passing away, we are burning the cathedral
- To stop this, we have to lock the wilderness away, leaving it untouched and pristine
- This turns wilderness into less of a cathedral and more of a theme park
- a figure in the idealized version of the frontier is the cowboy
- 
 
## Thoughts
- Our perception of wilderness as wasted land or pristine nature that should be protected goes hand in hand with the awareness of our ability to alter the natural world, for worse or for better( Jonas Thesis)
- We remember wilderness like we remember the trojan war
- The people who inhabited this frontier became legendary figures of idealized masculinity(Cowboys, Davy Crockett, etc)
- They are both a civilizing force and a symbol of the natural world we feel that we have lost. Striking out to know and fight against nature.
