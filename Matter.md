Matter is **anything that takes up space and has mass**
- Matter is particulate, made up of an incredible amount of tiny particles.
- The structure of these particles determines the properties of matter.
# What are the fundamental particles of matter?
The atom is the basic particle that composes all normal matter

# How do we Classify Matter?
We can classify matter both by
- Substance: A Specific instance of matter is a **substance** (Water, Sand, etc.)
- State: State describes a few basic properties of mater, and how particles of a given substance relate to each other(Solid, Liquid, or Gas)
- Composition: this describes what the matter is made up of. What [[Elements]] make up the particles, and what particles make up the matter?
# What are the states of matter?

## Solid
in Solid matter, particles are stuck closely together and fixed in place. They cannot move freely, only vibrate. They hold their shape , regardless of their container. 

## Liquid 
In a Liquid, the particles are still close together, but can slide past each other, allowing the liquid to flow, and assume the shape of it's container.

## Gas
A gas' particles are only weakly attracted to each other, causing a high degree of motion in individual particles, and allowing a gas to assume both the shape and volume of its container. Gasses are compressible, and when squeezed into a smaller shape, the particles will fit closer together.
