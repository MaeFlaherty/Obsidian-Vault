# How Do Igneous Rocks Form?
Form by the solidification of a melt

## Melt Byproducts
Lava - Melted Rock once it has Reached the surface
[[Magma]] - Melted Rock below the Surface
Tephra - Fragmented volcanic products formed during explosive eruptions

Igneous Rock "Freezes" at high pressures - **1100Cº - 650Cº**

# Intrusive Vs. Extrusive Igneous
## Extrusive
At or near the surface, Intrusive Igneous rocks tend to cool much faster and form smaller crystals without the insulation of the crust.
### Extrusive Settings
**Effusive Eruptions**: Lava Flows
**Explosive Eruptions**: Tephra explodes and is shot into the air


## Intrusive 
Cool at a depth below the surface. Intrusive igneous rocks cool slower, and tend to form larger crystals, as they are insulated by the crust
### Intrusive Settings
Intrusive igneous rocks are formed in a **Plutonic** setting
Magma enters pre existing rock by wither forcing it's way in, or percolating through small cracks in the rock.

**Dikes:** Cut across layers of sedimentary rock
**Sill:** Pushes Between layers of sedimentary rock. 


# Describing Igneous Rocks




Igneous rocks form from mid ocean ridges and continental volcanos, with magma pushing up through the crust, erupting out of a volcano, and eventually cooling and solidifying into Igneous Rock.
