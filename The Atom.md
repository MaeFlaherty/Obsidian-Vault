# What is an Atom?
The Modern Atomic Theory was defined by John Dalton in 1904, based on 3  Natural Laws. 
## Law of Conservation of Mass
In a Chemical reaction, Matter is neither Created nor destroyed.
## Law of Definite Proportions
All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source, have the same proportion of their constituent Elements.

## Law of Multiple Proportions
When 2 Elements form 2 different compounds, the masses of Element B that combine with a fixed mass(1g) of Element A can be expressed by a ratio of small whole numbers. 

# Subatomic Particles
All atoms are made up of even smaller particles, called protons, neutrons, and electrons
## Protons

## Neutrons

## Electrons

## Isotopes and Ions

## Chemical vs nuclear Reactions
A **Chemical Reaction** involves a stable nucleus reacting with other stable atoms. For this reason, and stable isotope of a given element will behave the same in a chemical reaction

a reaction involving atoms with an unstable nucleus is known as a **Nuclear Reaction** 
# Atomic Mass



# The Mole
Avogadro's Number/The mole
$$6.02*10^{23}$$ The average atomic mass of one atom of an element is the **same** as the average molar mass of that substance. 

# What is the origin of the Atom?
