# What is an Atom?
This question has been asked, answered, and argued over for over 2000 years.

# Historic Models of the Atom
The Model of the atom has gone through many different models to progress to the current quantum mechanical model

## Democritus' Solid Sphere Model
The first, fundamental description of an atom came from the greek philosopher Democritus in 400 B.C.E. He posited that the world was made up of infinitesimally tiny, solid spheres called atoms. These atoms varied in shape, size, mass, position, and arrangement, but they were indestructible and unchangeable. They make up the world and cannot be divided further.

## Dalton's Atomic Theory
Modern Atomic Theory was defined by John Dalton in 1904, based on 3  Natural Laws. 

### Law of Conservation of Mass
In a Chemical reaction, Matter is neither Created nor destroyed.
### Law of Definite Proportions
All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source, have the same proportion of their constituent Elements.

### Law of Multiple Proportions
When 2 Elements form 2 different compounds, the masses of Element B that combine with a fixed mass(1g) of Element A can be expressed by a ratio of small whole numbers. 


- Each Element is composed of tiny, indestructible particles called atoms. 
- all atoms of a given element have the same mass and properties of all other atoms of that element.
- Atoms combine in simple, whole number rations to form compounds. 
- Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. A chemical reaction only changes the way atoms bind together.

This model was partially accurate, but it was later discovered that atoms could be chipped, or changed. 

## Rutherford's Model of the Atom
- Most of an atom's mass is contained in a dense inner core called the nucleus
- Most a of an atom's volume is empty space, throughout which small, negatively charged **electrons** orbit the nucleus
- there are as many negatively charged electrons orbiting the atom as there are positively charged **protons** in the nucleus. 
## Bohr's model of the Atom
After The discovery of [[Energy#Light as a particle]], Niels Bohr developed a new model for the atom. 
- electrons did not orbit the atom freely, as in Rutherford's model, but were **quantized** to specific, fixed energy levels around the nucleus. 
- electrons could change energy levels when excited, but did so instantly, never being observed in a state between these  energy levels.
- When Electrons were excited, the atom absorbed energy. 
- As Electrons relaxed, they emitted electromagnetic energy in the form of photons. 
- no electromagnetic radiation is emitted by an electron orbiting in a stationary state. radiation was only emitted when 

# The Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom

# Subatomic Particles
All atoms are made up of even smaller particles, called protons, neutrons, and electrons
## Protons
Protons are **positively charged** subatomic particles that exist in the Nucleus
The number of protons in the atom defines what [[Element]] that atom is
## Neutrons
A neutron is a **neutrally charged** particle that esists in the nucleus of an atom. Typically, an atom has an equal number of protons and neutrons, unless it is an isotope.
Neutrons hold the nucleus together with the **Strong Nuclear Force**
## Electrons
An Electron is a negatively charged particle, with an atomic mass close to 0.
Electrons orbit the nucleus, held in place by the **weak nuclear force**, and can be closer or farther from the nucleus, depending on energy level.
An atom can gain or lose electrons, becoming an **ion**

## Isotopes and Ions

### What Is an Isotope?
When the number of neutrons in a given atom does not match the number of protons, that atom is called an **isotope**. This disproves part of daltons model, as all atoms of a given element do not have the same mass

#### What is the notation for an isotope?
$${}^{a}_{z}X$$
where 
A= total atomic mass
and
z= Atomic Number

#### Natural Abundance
Different atoms have different amounts of naturally occurring Isotopes. We can use the proportion of these isotopes to each other to calculate an element's natural atomic mass, which is a simple weighted average.

Average atomic mass = (mass of isotope 1 x abundance of isotope 1) + (mass of isotope 2 x abundance of isotope 2)


### What is an Ion?
When an atom of a given element loses or gains electrons, it becomes charged, and is called an **ion**. 

Positively sharged ions are called **cations**, and have **fewer** electrons than protons
negatively charged ions are called **anions**, and have **more** electrons than protons. 


## Chemical vs nuclear Reactions
A **Chemical Reaction** involves a stable nucleus reacting with other stable atoms. For this reason, and stable isotope of a given element will behave the same in a chemical reaction

a reaction involving atoms with an unstable nucleus is known as a **Nuclear Reaction** 
# Atomic Mass
The atomic mass  unit, or dalton, is defined as 1/12 the mass of a carbon atom containing 6 neutrons and 6 electrons.
$$1.660538921 x 10^-24g$$
Proton = $1.00727$amu
Neutron = 1.00866amu 
Electron = 0.00055amu


# The Mole
Avogadro's Number/The mole
$$6.02*10^{23}$$ The average atomic mass of one atom of an element is the **same** as the average molar mass of that substance. 

x amu = xg/mol of that element

# What is the origin of the Atom?
