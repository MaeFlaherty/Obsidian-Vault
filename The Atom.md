# What is an Atom?
This question has been asked, answered, and argued over for over 2000 years.

The Modern Atomic Theory was defined by John Dalton in 1904, based on 3  Natural Laws. 
## Law of Conservation of Mass
In a Chemical reaction, Matter is neither Created nor destroyed.
## Law of Definite Proportions
All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source, have the same proportion of their constituent Elements.

## Law of Multiple Proportions
When 2 Elements form 2 different compounds, the masses of Element B that combine with a fixed mass(1g) of Element A can be expressed by a ratio of small whole numbers. 

## Dalton's Atomic Theory
- Each Element is composed of tiny, indestructible particles called atoms. 
- all atoms of a given element have the same mass and properties of all other atoms of that element.
- Atoms combine in simple, whole number rations to form compounds. 
- Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. A chemical reaction only changes the way atoms bind together.

This model was partially accurate, but it was later discovered that atoms could be chipped, or changed. 

## Rutherford's Model of the Atom
- Most of an atom's mass is contained in a dense inner core called the nucleus
- Most a of an atom's volume is empty space, throughout which small, negatively charged **electrons** orbit the nucleus
- there are as many negatively charged electrons orbiting the atom as there are positively charged **protons** in the nucleus. 


# Subatomic Particles
All atoms are made up of even smaller particles, called protons, neutrons, and electrons
## Protons
Protons are positively charged subatomic particles that exist in the Nucleus
The number of protons in the atom defines what [[Element]] that atom is
## Neutrons
A neutron is a neutrally charged particle that esists in the nucleus of an atom. Typically, an atom has an equal number of protons and neutrons, unless it is an isotope.
Neutrons hold the nucleus together with the **Strong Nuclear Force**
## Electrons

## Isotopes and Ions

## Chemical vs nuclear Reactions
A **Chemical Reaction** involves a stable nucleus reacting with other stable atoms. For this reason, and stable isotope of a given element will behave the same in a chemical reaction

a reaction involving atoms with an unstable nucleus is known as a **Nuclear Reaction** 
# Atomic Mass
The atomic mass  unit, or dalton, is defined as 1/12 the mass of a carbon atom containing 6 neutrons and 6 electrons.
$$1.660538921 x 10^-24g$$
Proton = $1.00727$amu
Neutron = 1.00866amu 
Electron = 0.00055amu


# The Mole
Avogadro's Number/The mole
$$6.02*10^{23}$$ The average atomic mass of one atom of an element is the **same** as the average molar mass of that substance.
