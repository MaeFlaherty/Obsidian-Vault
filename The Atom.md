# What is an Atom?
This question has been asked, answered, and argued over for over 2000 years.

# Historic Models of the Atom
The Model of the atom has gone through many different models to progress to the current quantum mechanical model

## Democritus' Solid Sphere Model
The first, fundamental description of an atom came from the greek philosopher Democritus in 400 B.C.E. He posited that the world was made up of infinitesimally tiny, solid spheres called atoms. These atoms varied in shape, size, mass, position, and arrangement, but they were indestructible and unchangeable. They make up the world and cannot be divided further.

## Dalton's Atomic Theory
Modern Atomic Theory was defined by John Dalton in 1904, based on 3  Natural Laws. 

### Law of Conservation of Mass
In a Chemical reaction, Matter is neither Created nor destroyed.
### Law of Definite Proportions
All samples of a given compound, regardless of their source, have the same proportion of their constituent Elements.

### Law of Multiple Proportions
When 2 Elements form 2 different compounds, the masses of Element B that combine with a fixed mass(1g) of Element A can be expressed by a ratio of small whole numbers. 


- Each Element is composed of tiny, indestructible particles called atoms. 
- all atoms of a given element have the same mass and properties of all other atoms of that element.
- Atoms combine in simple, whole number rations to form compounds. 
- Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. A chemical reaction only changes the way atoms bind together.

This model was partially accurate, but it was later discovered that atoms could be chipped, or changed. 

## Rutherford's Model of the Atom
- Most of an atom's mass is contained in a dense inner core called the nucleus
- Most a of an atom's volume is empty space, throughout which small, negatively charged **electrons** orbit the nucleus
- there are as many negatively charged electrons orbiting the atom as there are positively charged **protons** in the nucleus. 
## Bohr's model of the Atom
After The discovery of [[Energy#Light as a particle]], Niels Bohr developed a new model for the atom. 
- electrons did not orbit the atom freely, as in Rutherford's model, but were **quantized** to specific, fixed energy levels around the nucleus. 
- electrons could change energy levels when excited, but did so instantly, never being observed in a state between these  energy levels.
- When Electrons were excited, the atom absorbed energy. 
- As Electrons relaxed, they emitted electromagnetic energy in the form of photons. 
- no electromagnetic radiation is emitted by an electron orbiting in a stationary state. radiation was only emitted when 

# The Quantum Mechanical Model of the Atom
- Unlike the Bohr Model, electrons can move as waves and particles, and could be in a given zone of places at any one time. 
- The probability of an electron can be calculated using Wave Equations
- these zones of probability have a certain shape, known as **orbitals**

## Quantum Numbers
$N$=  integer, principal quantum number, energy of the electron in a given orbital(shell). Think of this as the ring that the electron occupies in the bohr model. it takes 8 valence(outer ring) electrons to form a complete shell 

$l$ = goes from 0 - (n-1), described the shape of the orbital, or the **subshell**

$m_l$  = goes from $-l \to l$, determines how many orbitals there are of a type of orbital $l$

$m_s$= $1/2$ or $-1/2$, represents the spin value of an electron
### Pauli Exclusion Principle
Any given 2 electrons in an atom cannot have the same 4 quantum numbers, because any orbital can only hold up to 2 electrons, and even the electroons that share an orbital will have opposite spin($m_s$ )vaues. 
## Types Of Orbitals(Sub-Shell)

1-3-5-7, like a major 7th chord!(Harmonic Series)

These orbitals occur in all atoms, even if there are not enough electrons to fill them. 

## Notation for Electron Arrangment in Atoms
The SPDF notation uses numbers to designate a principal shell and the letters to identify a sub-shell
$$1s^1$$
*Electron Configuration for Hydrogen*

Noble Gasses represent the formation of a full shell, so for atoms with lots of electrons you can start at any noble gas and continue from there, known as **Noble Gas Notation**


Eg. The Electron Configuration for ${}_{73}Ta$
$$[Xe], 6s^2, 6p^3$$

## Distribution of Electrons across an atomic orbital
like people on a bus, electrons will pair together in an orbital only after all empty orbitals are filled. In addition to this, electrons in diagrams are shown as having the same spin until they start sharing orbitals.

## What Explains the variance in electron energy levels
a push and pull between the attraction of the charged protons and the electrons, and the repulsion of other electrons in the atom. This push and pull can balance, and reach a stable, low energy state, where the electrons are most symmetric. 

## Electron Shielding
Electron Shielding involves interaction between electrons on different energy levels and sublevels. 
![[Pasted image 20241017111116.png]]
**core** electrons surround the nucleus, blocking **some of** the positive energy from the nucleus, and repelling valence electrons. This causes the outside(valence) electrons to have no effect on the effective nuclear charge. 

When another **full** shell is formed around the core, it becomes part of the core.

subtract the number of electrons in the inner rings from the atomic number to get the effective nuclear charge acting on the valence electrons. 

## Electron Penetration
When an electron penetrates this core(gets closer to the nucleus), it reduces the energy of the electrons in this orbital. This happens because the "shells" are still just particles, and sometimes the orbits can overlap. 

The Kinetic energy goes down, but the attraction to the nucleus(potential energy) goes up. This causes emission of radiation. 
# Subatomic Particles
All atoms are made up of even smaller particles, called protons, neutrons, and electrons
## Protons
Protons are **positively charged** subatomic particles that exist in the Nucleus
The number of protons in the atom defines what [[Element]] that atom is
## Neutrons
A neutron is a **neutrally charged** particle that esists in the nucleus of an atom. Typically, an atom has an equal number of protons and neutrons, unless it is an isotope.
Neutrons hold the nucleus together with the **Strong Nuclear Force**
## Electrons
An Electron is a negatively charged particle, with an atomic mass close to 0.
Electrons orbit the nucleus, held in place by the **weak nuclear force**, and can be closer or farther from the nucleus, depending on energy level.
An atom can gain or lose electrons, becoming an **ion**

### Core vs. Valence Electrons
Core electrons are in completely filled energy shells and sub shells while in the ground state. These contribute to the electron shielding effect, and are very stable. The Noble Gasses have only core electrons. 
**valence electrons** exist in the unfilled, highest energy shell while in the ground state. These electrons are shielded from the full positive force of the nucleus, and are leass stable than core electrons, more likely to be exchanged with other atoms. 

For Core Elements, the number of valence electrons is the number of non-transition groups they are away(Carbon is in the 4th non-transition group, so it has 4 valence electrons)

Transition Elements fill in differently from main group elements, and you must count ALL incomplete sublevels(count from the last finished sublevel)




### Electron Particle-Wave Duality
Like [[Energy#The wave-particle duality|Light]], Electrons can behave both as a Wave and as a Particle. The Positions of These Electrons can be probabilistically predicted, but not know, using the orbitals. 

### Electron Configurations
The Ground State(lowest energy state) of a hydrogen atom is
$$1s^1$$
this represents the orbital and the number of electrons in the orbital



## Isotopes and Ions

### What Is an Isotope?
When the number of neutrons in a given atom does not match the number of protons, that atom is called an **isotope**. This disproves part of daltons model, as all atoms of a given element do not have the same mass

#### What is the notation for an isotope?
$${}^{a}_{z}X$$
where 
A= total atomic mass
and
z= Atomic Number

#### Natural Abundance
Different atoms have different amounts of naturally occurring Isotopes. We can use the proportion of these isotopes to each other to calculate an element's natural atomic mass, which is a simple weighted average.

Average atomic mass = (mass of isotope 1 x abundance of isotope 1) + (mass of isotope 2 x abundance of isotope 2)


### What is an Ion?
When an atom of a given element loses or gains electrons, it becomes charged, and is called an **ion**. 

Positively sharged ions are called **cations**, and have **fewer** electrons than protons
negatively charged ions are called **anions**, and have **more** electrons than protons. 


## Chemical vs nuclear Reactions
A **Chemical Reaction** involves a stable nucleus reacting with other stable atoms. For this reason, and stable isotope of a given element will behave the same in a chemical reaction

a reaction involving atoms with an unstable nucleus is known as a **Nuclear Reaction** 
# Atomic Mass
The atomic mass  unit, or dalton, is defined as 1/12 the mass of a carbon atom containing 6 neutrons and 6 electrons.
$$1.660538921 x 10^-24g$$
Proton = $1.00727$amu
Neutron = 1.00866amu 
Electron = 0.00055amu


# The Mole
Avogadro's Number/The mole
$$6.02*10^{23}$$ The average atomic mass of one atom of an element is the **same** as the average molar mass of that substance. 

x amu = xg/mol of that element

# What is the origin of the Atom?
