The water cycle is the process by which water uses to move through the world. Most of the earth's water is stored in oceans, but the sun evaporates this water, and wind distrubutes it around the globe. This vapor eventually forms clousd and precipitates in the form of rain, which then soaks into the ground as groundwater, or flows down in elevation, through rivers and eventually back to the ocean. This is known as the water table. 

# The Carbon Cycle
Carbon moves through the earth in a similar way. Carbon is changed from it's gaseous state and stored in photosynthetic organisms as sugars. consumers then eat these plants, excreting carbon dioxide as they use the sugars for cellular respiration, releasing the cO2 back into the atmosphere. When organisms die, the carbon stored in their cells is only released once decomposers digest their bodies, and this may not happen for thousands of years. Mass die offs of organic material that become buried can eventually turn into oil and other fossil fuels, stored deep in the earth. 

# The Nitrogen Cycle
Plants Acquire nitrogen from nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in and around their roots. these bacteria combine nitrogen with hydrogen, releasing ammonia and ammonium,
Other bacteria combine ammonia with oxygen to form nitrites.
a third group of bacteria turnes these nitrates into nitrates, which green plants absorb and use to grow by building ammino acids and proteins.

Fossil Fuel burning also contributes to atmospheric nitrogen

too much nitrogen, from fertilizer runoff or natural gas pollution, can collect in lakes, streams, and rivers, and cause Eutrophication, allowing blue green algae to bloom and kill off other organisms living in the water.

# The Phosphorous Cycle
the Phosphorous cycle takes millions of years.
Minerals are released from rocks and salts into soil. 
Plants can then use these inorganic molecules and convert them into usable nutrients, which then become available to consumers. 
When consumers die, these phosphates can reform into [[rocks]] through sedimentary deposits.
