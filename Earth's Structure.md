# What is the Earth's Chemical Composition?
The bulk of the earth is composed of iron, silicon, magnesium, oxygen, and other trace elements.

The Earth's crust is similar, but has a much lower concentration of iron, and is higher in silicon and oxygen. ![[Screenshot 2024-10-04 at 10.55.25 AM.png]]
### Why is the Earth's composition different at the center than on the crust?
Iron is a very dense element, and the core of the earth is almost pure iron, as gravity has a stronger pull on it. Therefore, the denser elements will be mostly closer to the center. This is detailed in [[Earth's Origins]]
