# What is the Earth's Chemical Composition?
The bulk of the earth is composed of iron, silicon, magnesium, oxygen, and other trace elements.

The Earth's crust is similar, but has a much lower concentration of iron, and is higher in silicon and oxygen. ![[Screenshot 2024-10-04 at 10.55.25 AM.png]]
### Why is the Earth's composition different at the center than on the crust?
Iron is a very dense element, and the core of the earth is almost pure iron, as gravity has a stronger pull on it. Therefore, the denser elements will be mostly closer to the center. This is detailed in [[Earth's Origins]]

# Inter-plate Volcanoes and hot spots
The mantle is not one uniform temperature across the entire earth's surface. These variations are caused by convection currents of heat rising through the mantle and burning through the crust, causing volcanoes that do not lie at plate boundaries.

As plates move, the hotspots stay in the same place, forming new Islands and subterranean volcanoes as the old islands move away from the hot spot. This can create inter plate island chains and volcanic belts.
