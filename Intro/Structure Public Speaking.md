Having a defined beginning and ending can reduce anxiety, and help you communicate your position to the audience. 

Connecting the beginning and end of a speech creates a structure and allows people to remember what you've said. Conclusion and introduction account for 90% of an effective speech

# Thesis
Know the purpose of your communication, and identify the central idea that you want to get across to them(a thesis). This applies to all forms of communication. 

# Introduction
Get people's attention(you need a HOOK)
- Relate the topic of your speech to the interests and needs of your audience
- "This applies to YOU", doesn't have to be complicated, but **must** be interesting
- Spark the listener's curiosity(but not to the point that they get lost and disengage)
- Ask a question! Rhetorical, philosophical, something that requires a bit of thinking

Reveal the topic

Establish credibility and goodwill 
- Why are you qualified to talk about this?
- "How does this apply to ME"
- 

Preview the evidence/thesis

# Content
Present multiple forms of evidence that support your thesis(Logos Pathos Ethos)

Stories, Statistics, Testimonies

Approach the idea from many different angles! dont throw exclusively anecdotes or exclusively statistics(Or if you do, vary the perspectives within the studies/stories)

Split your time between points(slightly weighted or evenly, don't devote most of your time to only one point)

## Deductive vs Inductive Reasoning
General to specific/Specific to general

## Contextual Reasoning
Establish a context, then allow your thesis to slot into place

## Transitions
Make sure you flow smoothly from one point to the next. Interrupting/transitioning abruptly is less effective. 

Internal previews, 

### Pauses 
Pauses can be an effective transition as well

# Conclusion

- Shorter than your intro
- Bring the audience back to your thesis, reinforce best parts, and close out the speech
- this is what people remember from your speech
- Columbo their asses; "Oh, and one more thing"
- 60 - 40 seconds
- End with a bang! be passionate at the end!
