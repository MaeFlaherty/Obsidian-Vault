# Competition
Occurs when a ppopulation or species shares one ot more depletable resource with another species or population
- Resources are critical for population growth
- Resources are depletable

## Intraspecific Competition
Between populations or individuals of the same species

## Interspecific competition
Between populations or individuals of different species

## Drivers of Competition
### Exploitative Competition
Indirect outcome resulting from species combined depletion of a shared resource
### Interference Competition
Direct outcome resulting from physical interactions over a shared space

## Schoner's 6 Mechanisms of Competition
### Consumption
One species inhibits another by consuming a shared resource

### Pre-emptive
One species occupies a physical space, making it unavailable for other species(crowding them out)
### Overgrowth
One species grows directly over another species, with or without physically contacting it(Trees in a canopy vs shrubs on the ground)

### Chemical
One species produces chemical growth inhibitors or toxins that harm or kill another species![[Screenshot 2025-01-14 at 2.48.46 PM.png]]

### Territoriality
One species excludes another from specific units of space by force
### Encounter
Non-territorial behavioral interactions between foraging species


# Predation

# Mutualism
Both Species benefit
## Parasitism
Mutualistic relationship, one species is slightly negatively effected, the other benefits
## Commensalism
One Species Benefits, the other is unaffected
## Amensalism
One species is negatively effected, the other is unaffected


# Ecological Niche
An ecological niche is a set of multi dimensional conditions that allows a specific species to thrive and reproduce

## Niche Overlap
When 2 species ecological niche overlap, competition occurs between the species

## Competitive Exclusion Principle
Coexisting species occupy non-overlapping ecological niches. This will cause species with overlapping niches to diverge over time, or for one species to drive the other to extinction within the overlapping niche
