for a series
$$
\sum^\infty_{n=1} u_k
$$
If:
$$
\lim_{k\to\infty}u_k\neq0
$$
Then the series diverges

**If:**
$$
\lim_{k\to\infty}u_k=0
$$
Then the series may converge or diverge

**This test is mostly useless, but it is easy to do, so it's usually the starting point if a function isn't obviously recognizable.
