# Award for most annoying interruptions
That one insanely loud frat boy who loves to hang out in the parking lot across from my bedroom

list study interruptions/times he woke me up screaming like football stats

Displays consistency - Drunk every friday of fall term, even finals week!

Braves harsh weather - Jumping from a trash can onto an ice patch screaming PARKOUR like it's 2012 again

Nobody breaks an old TV like him 

Loyalty - Always(loudly) supports the eagles, even when it's 4am

Rises above a crowd(volume wise) - He's the loudest of his friends, by far!


# speech
- I'm here to present an award to Kyle, the loud ass frat boy who likes to hang out in the parking lot directly beneath my bedroom window
- You Know, when I first met kyle, drunk, screaming, and throwing beer bottles at a fence, I have to admit, I was unimpressed.
