Flowering plants belong to a class of plant called angiosperms

# What is a flower? 
- ovules enclosed in carpels
double fertilization forms endosperm

1. Stigma
2. Style 
3. Ovary
Flowers evolved a diversity of petal colors and shapes to attract different pollinators that they have evolved to live alongside. They will develop these structures to select for a specific type of pollinator.

## Example
- Fly pollinated flowers will have a maroon or "raw meat" colored flower, and smell like decomposing bodies to attract flies
- Butterfly or hummingbird pollinated flowers will have tubular forms to allow the long proboscises to drink their nectar and pollinate other plants
- bat pollinated flowers will bloom in the night time rather than in the day, and are usually white, as the color doesn't matter as much
- Bee pollinated flowers have bright colors, and reflect ultraviolet light that attracts the bees visually. 

	

## Flower Structure
### pedicel
Holds the flower up, comes off of the stem
### sepals
Protects the flower as it develops, then opens
### Stamens(Male)
Pollen producing structure
### Pistil(Female)
recieves pollen on its ends 


## Structure

### Symmetry
Regular: radially symmetrical
irregular: Bilaterally symmetrical

### Fusions 
Sometimes, Structures can fuse together and form other structures

#### Conate
Petals are fused together



### Ovary Position
inferior: lies at the base of the flower


### Monocots vs Eudicots
There are 2 groups of angiosperms 
# Importance of Angiosperms and Wildflowers
## Agriculture
- Attracts pollinators, allowing them to populate the main crop as well
- reduces need for toxic chemicals
- requires little water or maintenance

medicine, and decoration

# Wildflowers
- Herbaceous(non woody)
- Native or naturalized to the area

## Types of wildflowers

### Annuals
grows, flowers, and sets seeds in one season, then dies

### Perennials
grows first year, and flowers year after year

### Biannuals
Grows one year, flowers and dies the next year

# Identifying Wildflowers
Nearly 4000 species, making a dichotomous key impractical

# Grasses
Some Angiosperms have minimized showy flowers, relying on wind pollination rather than pollinator organisms. one of these families are grasses

- 2 ranked(distichous) leaves
- stems rounded with enlarged joints
- inflorescences with minimal petals clustered together 
## Sedges 
edged stems

## Grass
hollow round stems
joints
2 ranked leaves

## Rush
solid round stem
no joints
3 ranked leaves
