Thermonuclear reactions inside the sun produce lots of radiation, including ultraviolet light and nuclear radiation. Plants have evolved to harness this radiation and convert it into light sustaining energy. 

$$6CO_2 + 6H2O \to C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$

# How does Photosynthesis capture Energy?
Photosynthesis can be broken into 2 connected cycles of reactions.

## Light Dependent Reactions
Small Plant organelles called Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis. These organelles have a high concentration of chlorophyll, a light sensitive green molecule.

chlorophyl absorbs light, and consumes water in a light sensitive reaction, producing ATP for the plant to use as energy. A byproduct of this reaction is $O_2$, or oxygen that is released back into the atmosphere.

## Light Independent reactions
ATP produced by chlorophyl is used to produced sugars in the calvin cycle, using $CO_2$ to produce glucose that the plant can move around, store, and break down for energy later. this is why plants act as a carbon sink!
