For a series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty u_k$ with positive terms if a function $f$ is positive, continuous on $[a, \infty)$, and decreasing, AND $u_k = f(k)\forall k>a$  then
$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty u_k 
$$
and
$$
\int^\infty_af(x)dx
$$
Both converge or both diverge

so if the limit of the integral based on the original series is a finite number, the series converges. if not, the series diverges. 
REMEMBER PCD
---
**Positive**: The function must have positive terms
**Continuous**: The function must be continuous on $[a, \infty)$
**Decreasing**: The function must be decreasing(check if the first derivative is negative)

>Use this as a last resort when all other convergence tests have failed
