# Origins of the Universe
---
The Universe was created in the big bang, an enormous explosion. 
### What were the first elements present in the universe?
- hydrogen
- helium
- lithium
over billions of years, these elements were pulled together by gravity, creating starts, and were subjected to nuclear reactions in the core of these stars

### What Elements were created in the first generation of Stars?
nuclear reactions caused the first elements to exchange protons and electrons, creating every element up to iron.

### Post-Supernova Elements
Eventually, these stars ran out of fuel, and exploded into supernovae, creating the rest of the elements in the universe. 

# Planets and Planetoids
---
As the universe got older and cooler, these newly created elements started to pull together under the force of gravity. 

## How did these Planetoids form?
The densest elements, like iron, collected at the center, with the less dense elements and new minerals, like silicates, forming the crust. rarely, the least dense elements, gasses like hydrogen and helium, forming an atmosphere. one of these planetoids would eventually become our earth, one of the few planets with an atmosphere capable of supporting life.

We can learn about these planetoids, including the early composition of earth, from the mineral composition of meteorites. 


## The Moon
---
Early in the earth's existence, another planetoid crashed into it with incredible violence. this second planetoid glanced off, and formed a circular orbit around the earth. That planetoid would eventually become earth's only moon, luna

### Why does the earth have more iron at its core than the moon?
When the moon and the earth collided, a part of the moons core was left on earth, causing this strange relationship.
