suppose you have a sequence of real numbers $(a_n)^\infty_{n=1}$ and $\sum^\infty_{n=1}a_n$ has [[Conditional Convergence]].
Let $M$ be any real number. 
Then there is a rearrangement $\sigma_k$ of the sequence such that $\sum^\infty_{n=1}a_{\sigma_n} = M$
There also exists a rearrangement $\sigma_n$ such that $\sum^\infty_{n=1}a_{\sigma_n}$ diverges.
