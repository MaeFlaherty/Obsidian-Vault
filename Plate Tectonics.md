# Continental Drift
---

This Theory was proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912, when he observed that the edges of the continents lined up with each other

Wegener theorized that the continents were once one enormous landmass. , and had drifted apart over millions of years
### Problems With Wegener's Hypothesis
- No Mechanism proposed for moving continents.
- Wegener wasn't a geologist, so his credibility was questioned.(Academia Moment)

# Magnetic inclination of the earth
---

The center of earth is made of iron, so earth has a magnetic field
Magnetic pole is about 10ยบ off spin axis of earth
this field wobbles and sometimes flips

This field acts on metals and ricks within the earth. For example, lava excites the magnetic dipoles within the rock, but as it cools, these dipoles will stop moving facing the direction of the field relative to their position.

We can date volcanic rocks and find where they were formed based on the orientation of these dipoles and what layer of rock it lies within.

Observing this leads us to believe that the continents are moving over time, as magnetic orientations are different in different layers of rock. We call this **Polar Wander**

# Marine Magnetic Anomalies
---

Observing a submarine volcanic ridge near iceland, we found evidence of the magnetic poles switching based on the age and polarity of the rocks at the center of the ridge vs off to the side
This also meant that the ridge was creating new rocks that formed and cooled
extending this idea gives us a new idea of how the continents were moving around. They had been forced apart at the mid ocean ridge!!

# Tectonic Plates
---

The earth is divided into a series of plates, bordered by volcanic ridges. These plates constantly move around, pulling apart, rubbing together, and crashing into each other. 

All this happens at a rate of about 2mm/year on average(about the speed your fingernails grow)

### Divergent Plates
Two plates move away from each other, leaving a gap between them. Depending on the type of plate, these can form a few distinct structures.

**Mid-Ocean Ridges**
when 2 oceanic plates diverge, magma flows up from the surface to form new crust, filling the gap. the polarity of this new crust aligns with the current magnetic field of the earth, giving us information about the age of the earth and when the magnetic field has flipped in the past. 

**Rifts**
a divergent rift is where 2 continental plates pull apart from each other.  somaliland and the rest of the African continent. This will eventually cause somaliland to break off, and form a new ocean between the 2 land masses.

### Convergent Plates
- the plates move towards each other, crashing into each other. the denser crust will go under the less dense crust(continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust) and fall into the mantle, dragging the rest of the plate forward with it. 

**oceanic subduction**
when 2 oceanic plates converge, the older, denser plate is subducted into the earth's core. This forms an oceanic trench, and sometimes a volcanic island chain. 

**oceanic-continental Subduction**
oceanic plate goes under continental plate, and is recycled into the mantle. a trench is formed off the continent

**Continental Collision** 
When 2 continental plates collide, they crash into each other and form a mountain range. The Indian subcontinent is currently still crashing into asia, causing a massive mountain range. 
### Transform Plates
- The plates move and rub alongside each other. 
**Transform Fault**
