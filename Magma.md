# Why does Magma form?
Magma is formed both at plate boundaries , and at  [[Earth's Structure#Inter-plate Volcanoes and hot spots|Interplate Hot Spots]] 

Magma is not everywhere beneath the earth's crust, and only forms in specific tectonic settings. Remember, the lithosphere is not liquid, but solid and **Ductile**. The conditions must exist for this ductiile material to fully melt into liquid form. 

## What are the causes of melting?

### Pressure Release
the base of the crust is hot enough to melt mantle rock, but the mantle is under such high pressure that it does not melt. if the pressure on this rock decreased by travelling towards the surface, the rock can melt. This magma then burns its way closer to the surface, forming a feedback loop that thins the crust, forming more magma and eventually creating a volcano. 
### Volatile Addition
Some compounds are volatile, and can decrease the melting point of mantle rock. When a plate subducts into the mantle, it can take these compounds, like CO2 and H2O with it, causing the mantle around the subducted plate to melt and convect to the surface. this is why volcanic arcs form at subduction zones. 
### Heat Transfer


# What Is Magma Made of?
- Solids: Solidified Mineral Crystals are carried in the melt
- Liquids: The melt itself, is mostly silicon and oxygen ions, with other elements mixed in
- Different Mixes of elements yield different forms of magma
## Magma Variation
Rocks are made up of different minerals with different melting points, and when melted, not everything in the rock dissolves completely. silicon rich minerals melt first, with silicon poor minerals melting last, or not melting at all, dependent on temperature.
