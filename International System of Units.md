the SI system, or **Metric system** is a standardize way of measuring natural phenomena

# Prefix Multipliers
when you need to refer to a whole bunch of one unit, or a very small amount of it, you can use prefix multipliers.

You really only encounter exa through pico in normal use, which go up through the first 3 decimal places, then by powers of 3.

# Converting Between Units
if you have an established proportion between 2 units, which all SI units have, you can convert from one unit to another using dimensional analysis. 

### Example
 if we want to convert 12.5 inches to centimeters, and we know that 1 inch = 2.54cm. we can establish a conversion factor of
$$
\frac{2.54cm}{1in}
$$
we can then multiply our number of inches by this number to cancel out the units, leaving us
$$12.5*\frac{2.54cm}{1}=31.75cm$$
To convert down, simply multiply by the reciprocal
$$3.8*\frac{1in}{2.54cm}=12.5$$

dimensional analysis takes the form of $$xu_1*\frac{u_2}{u_1}=xu_2$$
