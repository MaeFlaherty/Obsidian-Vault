# What is a Natural History Museum?
A building where objects of historical or scientific importance are kept, studied, and displayed.

The objects are specimens of biological material or minerals exemplary of earths biodiversity.

Specimens are put on display for education and entertainment, but the majority of a museum's collection is kept safe in an archive for preservation and study

# What are Natural history Collections?
Specimens are gathered together and associated with a standardized set of data. This data is as important(if not more) thank the specimen itself. 

Specimens are collected and stored for: 

- Conservation - Minimize entropy, preserve specimens for hundreds of years
- Access - Make the specimens and data available for viewing and study by the public
- Comprehensiveness - Represent a range of taxonomic groups, habitats, time periods, and regions.




## What can We learn from them?

### Specimens vs photos

Specimen: genetic material, Actual size/scale, microscopic structure/morphology, chemical composition, age data

Photo: Color/3d information(specimen's state pre preservation), less invasive, more accessible

Both: Morphology, Location, Habitat, Date/time, ecological interactions, change over time(Evolution, mutation, adaptations, etc)

## Additional Data
In the modern day, different types of data are often collected alongside a physical specimen
- Field Notes/Location Data
- Photos/Videos
- Sound Recordings(Animals)
- Genetic Vouchers/tissue samples(destroyed during analysis)
## Specimen Identification
Over the course of natural history collections, the way we identify species has changed. Specimens are associated with a record of who studied them and how they were identified at the time, as well as when the identification was changed. 

## Other values of a Natural History specimen
specimens may also have cultural, social, and historical value

Natural history is inextricably tied to human history


## History of Natural History collections
originally created as aid for medical education(medicinal plants and how to find/identify them) 

Started pressing plants into a book to record more detailed data
