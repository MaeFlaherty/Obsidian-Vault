# What is a Natural History Museum?
A building where objects of historical or scientific importance are kept, studied, and displayed.

The objects are specimens of biological material or minerals exemplary of earths biodiversity.

Specimens are put on display for education and entertainment, but the majority of a museum's collection is kept safe in an archive for preservation and study

# What are Natural history Collections?
Specimens are gathered together and associated with a standardized set of data. This data is as important(if not more) thank the specimen itself. 

Specimens are collected and stored for: 

- Conservation - Minimize entropy, preserve specimens for hundreds of years
- Access - Make the specimens and data available for viewing and study by the public
- Comprehensiveness - Represent a range of taxonomic groups, habitats, time periods, and regions.




## What can We learn from them?

### Specimens vs photos

Specimen: genetic material, Actual size/scale, microscopic structure/morphology, chemical composition, age data

Photo: Color/3d information(specimen's state pre preservation), less invasive, more accessible

Both: Morphology, Location, Habitat, Date/time, ecological interactions, change over time(Evolution, mutation, adaptations, etc)
