# Photoelectric Effect
the emission of electrons by metals when light of certain Energy interacts with their surface.

Light of a certian wavelength(energy) kicks out electrons out of metal atoms, if it is able to overcome the weak nuclear force hodling the electrons in orbit. 

The fact that light can interact with electrons, which have mass, means that light is a particle with 0 mass, known as a **Photon**

The Energy released by a photon = the Energy absorbed by the electron, known as the Law of Conservation of Energy

Light is not a wave, but a stream of photons

the energy of a photon = $h\nu = hc/\lambda$ 
$c = 3.00 * 10^8$
where $h = 6.626*10^{-34}$kg/s
