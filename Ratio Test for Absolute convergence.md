Basically applying the [[Ratio Test]] to [[Absolute Convergence]] by inserting the absolute value of the series into the original test
$$
\sum^\infty_{k=1}u_k
$$
is a series with nonzero terms, and let
$$
p = \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{|u_k+1|}{|u_k|}
$$
if p < 1, the series converges absolutely
if p > 1 then the series diverges. 
if p = 1, the test is inconclusive.
