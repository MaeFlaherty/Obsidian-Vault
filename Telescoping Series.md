A Telescoping series is a [[Series]] that usually has a term $t_n = a_n+1 - a_n$, or
$$
\sum^\infty_{n=1}\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \sum^\infty_{n=1}\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}
$$
for each term in the series, the following term cancels out, so for any number of finite terms, the sum of the series is 
$$
1-\frac{1}{N+1}
$$
this is the initial term of the series, and the final term of the series. all other terms have cancelled each other out.
