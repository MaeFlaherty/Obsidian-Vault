A greedy algorithm is a type of [[Algorithm]] that makes the best decision for the current state of the program(Has no memory) This will typicall deliver a solution to a problem faster then a [[Brute Force Algorithm]], where all possible solutions are considered, but may result in a sub optimal solution. 





### Examples of Greedy Algorithms
- [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]
- [[Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree]]
- [[Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree]]
- [[Huffman Coding]]
- [[Graph Coloring]]
