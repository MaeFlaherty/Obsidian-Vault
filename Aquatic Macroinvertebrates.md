## What is phylum arthropoda?
includes insects, crustaceans, and some other groups.

## Insects

### How do we tell an insect from other arthropods?

# Insects and Water Quality Monitoring
The kind of insects living in a body of water, and the health of these populations provides vital information on water quality and the presence or absence of pollution. 

Biological monitoring is dependent on accurate Identification of these species. 

Physical, Chemical, and Biological Measurements of water quality, taken together, can provide a more accurate picture of the quality of a given water system. 

## Why do insects respond to stream impacts?
### Respiration
insects breathe through holes in their body called spiracles. air enters a spiracle and travels through a network of air filled tubes until it reaches the insect's body/circulatory system. 

#### Variation in Oxygen Levels
There is much less oxygen in water than there is in air(200,000 ppm vs 15 ppm max in water), so aquatic insects have adapted to these low oxygen levels in a variety of ways

The level of oxygen in freshwater varies with flow and temperature, so at night, the temperature lowers, and so does water oxygenation. 

Open system requires insects to resurface to breath air, or allows insects to bring a bubble of air inside them from the surface. 

- Adapted to low/no flow zones, like ponds and lakes, with high fulctuations in oxygen levels.

Closed Systems derive oxygen entirely from the water, through gills or through the body itself(in the case of smaller insects)

- adapted to fast flowing streams with consistent oxygenation
#### Pollution's effect on Oxygenation
a common form of pollution is eutrophication, which can cause algal blooms. These can combine to lower the oxygen level in an environment, causing problems for closed system insects, who cannot draw their oxygen from air when water oxygenation lowers.
