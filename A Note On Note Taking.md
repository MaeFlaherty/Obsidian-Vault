# What is the goal of taking notes?

 to build a personal base of knowledge 
return to and review things I learned years ago
Study off these notes using spaced repetition to pass exams

# Reading Textbooks
Reading textbooks can seem boring and unproductive at first, but once you become familiar with how to do it properly, they can be some of the most powerful tools for learning. 

## Reading Process For Textbooks
### 1. Skim the book
before diving into the chapter, skim over all of the subchapter names, headings, and bolded words. This allows you to get somewhat familiar with the material before you dive into dense, technical explanations of the concepts within. It also allows you to compose an outline for your notes, so you dont have to waste time figuring out how to structure them as you read later.

### 2. Read the book! 
read one page of the textbook at a time, but don't take any notes yet!! just allow your brain to absorb the information and new concepts

### 3. Close the book
Ok, now its time to take notes, but before you do, **close the book!!** that sounds counterproductive, i know, but by simply writing down everything you remember from that page, you are using your brain's retrieval system, which is how you start actually making things stick in your head. It also makes it more likely for you to explain concepts in your own words, rather than blindly copying things from the book and having to reread when you forget them. 

### 4. Check the book
Do one final skim of the book, and make sure you didn't miss anything during your recall. then, rinse and repeat!

## Using Questions
When in lectures, avoid copying the professor's notes or speech word for word. Instead, phrase the concept being taught as a question. 


## Linking Concepts
When linking, ask yourself

1. What does this remind me of?
2. What is this similar to?
3. How is this different from?
4. this is important because?
