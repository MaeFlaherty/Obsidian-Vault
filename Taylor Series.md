Taylor Series are a collection of polynomials made from [[Local Linear Approximations]] of a given function. a local linear approximation of a function at a point $x_o$ is known as the **First Taylor Polynomial**. 

The **2nd Taylor Polynomial** is a polynomial where
$$
p_2(x_o) = f(x_o),
$$
$$
p_2'(x_o) = f'(x_o),
$$
$$
p_2''(x_o) = f''(x_o)
$$
So the **nth taylor polynomial** is a function $p(x_o)$ who's nth derivative is equal to $f(x_o)$
 taylor polynomials where $x_0 = 0$ are known as  [[Maclaurin Polynomials]]
