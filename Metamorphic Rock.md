### Metamorphic Rock
Formed when preexisting rock is exposed to Heat or Pressure, or change in composition of pore fluids

Metamorphic rocks are formed at continental plate barriers, where energy from the collision or divergence of plates stressed the rock, exposing it to heat and pressure, causing the rock that is already there to recrystallize into different types of rock. 

New Minerals form as a result of these changes, and grains recrystalize at the same time, causing textural changes
