### Metamorphic Rock
Formed when preexisting rock is exposed to Heat or Pressure

Metamorphic rocks are formed at continental plate barriers, where energy from the collision or divergence of plates stressed the rock, exposing it to heat and pressure, causing the rock that is already there to recrystallize into different types of rock.
