# Natural Selection 
Evolution works based on the process of natural selection. Animals develop a diversity of traits through mutation, and if these traits help them survive and reproduce more effectively than others of it's species, then the beneficial trait will be passed on to later generations, **selecting** for the beneficial trait over others

## Mutations
Mutations happen randomly during reproduction. Random variations in genetics cause animals to develop slight differences that are then selected for. Most of the time, these mutations are not beneficial, or even harm the animal.
