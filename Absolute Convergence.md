A [[series]] is said to converge absolutely if
$$
\sum^\infty_{k=1}|u_k|
$$
Converges

If a series converges absolutely, then it converges.
### Example
Determine if the given series converges absolutely.
$$
\sum^\infty_{k=1}(-1/3)^k
$$
$$
\sum^\infty_{k=1}|(-1/3)^k| = \sum^\infty_{k=1}(\frac{1}{3})^k
$$
which is a geometric series where $r<1$ , so the series **converges absolutely**

### Example
$$
\sum^\infty_{k=1}(-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k}
$$
$$
\sum^\infty_{k=1}|(-1)^{k+1}\frac{1}{k}| = \sum^\infty_{k=1}\frac{1}{k}
$$
which diverges, harmonic series. so the original series does NOT converge absolutely
