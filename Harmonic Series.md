A harmonic series is a [[Series and Sequences]] that takes the form
$$
\sum^\infty_{n = 1}\frac{1}{n}
$$
This series is known to **diverge**

--- 
## Why Does the series diverge?

the terms of this sequence are
$$
1+ \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+ \frac{1}{4}+ \frac{1}{5}+ \frac{1}{6}+ \frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{8}
$$
this sequence will always be greater than 
$$
1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}
$$
which is the same as this series, which diverges
$$
\sum^\infty_{n=1}\frac{1}{2}
$$
by the [[Direct Comparison Test]], the harmonic series diverges.
