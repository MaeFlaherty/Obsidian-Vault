All Life on earth is connected in the **biosphere**, and different levelso of connection relate areas, individual species, and individual Animals

# Biosphere
This Encompasses all life on earth, and the physical earth itself, including the water table and atmosphere

## Ecosystem
A biological community and the physical environment that it exists inside of.

## Community
All populations of different species living in a given area

## Population
All the organisms of a single species living in an area

## Species 
All organisms of the same kind that are genetically related enough to breed and produce live, fertile offspring. 

# Trophic Levels
An organism's trophic level describes what level it lies at in the food web. **Primary Producers**(autotrophs) do not directly consume other organisms, and produce their own energy through photosynthesis. 

**Consumers**, or heterotrophs, eat other organisms to obtain energy, whether they are herbivores, eating only plants, omnivores, or carnivores, feeding on other consumer organisms.

**Scavengers** are consumers that feed off of already dead animals

**Decomposers**, like insects and fungi, also feed on dead organisms, breaking down their biomass into energy and nutrients, which return to the soil
