# How Do Igneous Rocks Form?
Form by the solidification of a melt

## Melt Byproducts
Lava - Melted Rock once it has Reached the surface
[[Magma]] - Melted Rock below the Surface
Tephra - Fragmented volcanic products formed during explosive eruptions

Igneous Rock "Freezes" at high pressures - **1100Cº - 650Cº**

# Intrusive Vs. Extrusive Igneous
## Extrusive
At or near the surface, Intrusive Igneous rocks tend to cool much faster and form smaller crystals without the insulation of the crust.
### Extrusive Settings
**Effusive Eruptions**: Lava Flows
**Explosive Eruptions**: Tephra explodes and is shot into the air


## Intrusive 
Cool at a depth below the surface. Intrusive igneous rocks cool slower, and tend to form larger crystals, as they are insulated by the crust
### Intrusive Settings
Intrusive igneous rocks are formed in a **Plutonic** setting, when magma pushes up and makes contact with pre-existing rock.

Magma enters pre existing rock by either forcing it's way in, or percolating through small cracks in the rock.

**Dikes:** Cut across layers of sedimentary rock
**Sill:** Pushes Between layers of sedimentary rock. 


# Describing Igneous Rocks
Igneous Rock are defined by texture and Mineral Composition

## Texture
reflects magma history and the way it cooled


## Mineral Composition
reflects magma composition

Igneous rocks are mainly composed of silicate minerals
mineral composition is determined by the chemical composition of magma. 

# Igneous Rock Classification
## Igneous Classification
### Felsic
- Rich in Si(~70%), and makes up most of the continental crust.
- Light Colored 
### Intermediate
- Minerals: Pyroxene, Amphibole, plagioclase
- Andesire and Diorite
- ≥ 25% dark minerals

### Mafic
- Minerals: Olivine and Plagioclase(Ca-rich)
- Basalt(Aphanitic and Gabbro(Phaeneritic)
- Denser and Darker Colored
- Oceanic Crust and Volcanic Islands
- Low viscosity lava flows on melt
### Ultramafic
- Texture: Phaneritic
- Minerals: Olivine and Pyroxene
- Almost entirely dark, heavy minerals
- Peridotite, makes up the upper mantle, uncommon at the surface
- Produces Mafic magmas by partial melting
