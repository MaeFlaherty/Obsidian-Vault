# What is a wave?
a wave is a propogation of disturbances travelling from place to place in a regular and organized way, basically, it is energy in motion.

# Types of Waves
Waves are a great structure for understanding a wide vairiety of concepts in physics.
## Transverse Waves
transverse waves are like waves in the ocean, with a surface going up and down, forming peaks and troughs as it travels. 
## Longitudinal Waves
Longitudinal waves are more like sound waves, regulay bands of compression and decompression, but can be represented as peaks and troughs similar to transverse waves.

## Mechanical vs Electromagnetic Waves
Mechanical Waves, like sound or water waves, require a medium to travel through, while electromagnetic waves can happily travel through a vacuum.

# Properties of a Wave

The top of a wave is known as a peak, while it's lowest point is known as a trough
## Frequency
The Frequency of a wave is the amount of times a wave cycles through a given point in a unit of time. this is commonly measured in Hertz, or the amount of cycles per second.
## Wavelength
The Wavelength of a wave is the distance of one cycle of that wave, from baseline to baseline.
## Interference
When 2 waves interact, they influence each other, either cancelling each other out or building each other up. 
### Constructive Interference
When 2 waves are in *phase* with each other(Their peaks and troughs are aligned perfectly), they combine to form a wave of double the amplitude
### Destructive Interference
If 2 waves are completely *out of phase* with each other(their peaks and troughs are opposite of each other) they cancel each other out and stop the wave.

## Diffraction

When a wave encounters a barrier with a slit comparable in size to it's wavelength, it bends around it. Think of the lens of a projector taking in a stream of light and spreading it out over a large movie screen.

### Diffraction Pattern

When a beam of light passes through 2 small slits, the distance of the beam's wavelength apart, the resulting diffracted waves on the other end will show a striped diffraction pattern, with the image in the very center being in sync, and therefore brighter, and the image differing by $\lambda/2$ being cancelled by destructive interference, appearing black. An Extended version of this principle is how analog camera and projector technology works.
