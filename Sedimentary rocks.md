### Sedimentary rocks
cementing together rock fragments by precipitation of mineral crystals out of water solutions, eg. in a riverbed over thousands of years.

Sedimentary rocks form at passive margins, ocean shores where no subduction is occurring. Sediment from the ocean is deposited on the shore, where further layers are deposited on top, eventually compacting into sedimentary rock.

Sedimentary rock can also be formed from erosion. as wind and water wears away at existing rocks and rock outcroppings, eventually collecting the sediment and transforming it into sedimentary rock.
