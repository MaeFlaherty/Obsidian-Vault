### Sedimentary rocks
cementing together rock fragments by precipitation of mineral crystals out of water solutions, eg. in a riverbed over thousands of years.

Sedimentary rocks form at passive margins, ocean shores where no subduction is occurring. Sediment from the ocean is deposited on the shore, where further layers are deposited on top, eventually compacting into sedimentary rock.

Sedimentary rock can also be formed from erosion. as wind and water wears away at existing rocks and rock outcroppings, eventually collecting the sediment and transforming it into sedimentary rock. 

# Importance of Sedimentary Rock
## Resource Extraction
~85-90% of the mineral products in the world come from sedimentary deposits

Gas, Petroleum, groundwater, sand(silica used in semiconductors, gravel and concrete) all come from sedimentary rock deposits.
## History of the Natural World
Many dead organisms collect in sedimentary rocks and fossilize. Carbon, nutrients, and ash concentrations in different bands of sedimentary rock can give evidence of local and global catastrophes and weather eventsThis makes sedimentary rocks vital in the study of life on earth

### Uniformitarianism
The present is the key to the past. James Hutton Realized you can observe how sediment is deposited today, and "read" the layers of sedimentary rock to discover how other environments could have looked like millions of years ago. 
# How are Sedimentary Rocks Formed?
## Weathering
Generation of detritus via rock disintegration 
### Mechanical Weathering
 substance gets into cracks in the rock, widening them and eventually wedging off bits of rock
**caused by:**
- Frost
- Salt
- Plant Roots
### Chemical Weathering
Rain contains cO2, which makes it slightly acidic
this breaks down and dissolves the more basic rock, forming cracks and weakening it further and further over time. 
## Erosion
removal of sediment grains from parent rock
## Transport
Dispersal of sediment by gravity, wind, water, and ice
### Maturity
As eroded sediment gets older and transported around, it tumbles and degrades, getting rounder and smoothing of fthe sediments sharp corners. 

Smaller, rounder grains are considered to be more mature than larger, more angluar grains(like artificial sand made with a hammer versus highly eroded beach sand or clay.)

## Deposition
settling out of the transporting fluid and settling

## Clastic Sedimentary Rock

### Breccia
Angular, Large Fragments
Immature, little transport
deposited close to clast source(under a cliff face)

### Conglomerate
coarse, rounded dark rock clasts
deposited further from river than breccia(river channel)

### Arkose
sand and gravel with abundant feldspar
Commonly deposited in alluvial fans 
Feldspar indicates hort transport and arid conditions

### Sandstone
made of sand sized particles
common in beach and dune settings
quartz dominant element
small particles can be transported by wind or water, found on beaches or in deserts. 

### Silt and Clay
form mudstone and shale
deposited in quiet water settings(floodplains, mud flats, deep ocean)
 

## Lithification
transformation into solid rock.(precipitation from water, etc.)

How a rock goes from sediment to sedimentary rock

### Compaction
primarily caused by compaction - the increase of pressure and temperature.

Pressure squeezes water out of sediment and encourages formation of mineral crystals
Compaction goes in bands, forming **cement**(quartz or calcite), which glues the sediments together. 

## Diagenesis
Physical, Chemical, and biological changes to sediment

**Bioturbation** changes caused by organisms burrowing into the seidment(crabs, sand worms)
**Lithification**
**Dissolution**
**Mineral Precipitation**

# Sedimentary Structures
Features imparted to sediments at or near deposition
- Bedding and Stratification
- Surface Features on bedding layers(fossils)
- Arrangement of grains within bedding layers
All of these provide information about the conditions at sedimentation


Sedimentary layers are usually layered or stratified
arranged in planar, close to horizontal beds
Tilt in stratification happens after lithification

Current and Flow features
Sometimes sedimentary rocks formed under water can show the currents of that water in ripple marks(you can step in the same river twice, as long as the river is millions of years old!)

Dunes are similar to ripples, but much larger and impermanent
dunes migrate based on the position of the wind, with finer sand on the windward side and coarser gravel on the leeward side.
