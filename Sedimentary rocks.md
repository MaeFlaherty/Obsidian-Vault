### Sedimentary rocks
cementing together rock fragments by precipitation of mineral crystals out of water solutions, eg. in a riverbed over thousands of years.

Sedimentary rocks form at passive margins, ocean shores where no subduction is occurring. Sediment from the ocean is deposited on the shore, where further layers are deposited on top, eventually compacting into sedimentary rock.

Sedimentary rock can also be formed from erosion. as wind and water wears away at existing rocks and rock outcroppings, eventually collecting the sediment and transforming it into sedimentary rock. 

# Importance of Sedimentary Rock
## Resource Extraction
~85-90% of the mineral products in the world come from sedimentary deposits

Gas, Petroleum, groundwater, sand(silica used in semiconductors, gravel and concrete) all come from sedimentary rock deposits.
## History of the Natural World
Many dead organisms collect in sedimentary rocks and fossilize. Carbon, nutrients, and ash concentrations in different bands of sedimentary rock can give evidence of local and global catastrophes and weather eventsThis makes sedimentary rocks vital in the study of life on earth

### Uniformitarianism
The present is the key to the past. James Hutton Realized you can observe how sediment is deposited today, and "read" the layers of sedimentary rock to discover how other environments could have looked like millions of years ago. 
# How are Sedimentary Rocks Formed?
## Weathering
Generation of detritus via rock disintegration 
### Types of weathering
Mechanical - substan
## Erosion
removal of sediment grains from parent rock=
## Transport
Dispersal of sediment by gravity, wind, water, and ice
## Deposition
settling out of the transporting fluid
## Lithification
transformation into solid rock.(precipitation from water, etc.)
