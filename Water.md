# water as a natural resource
The Hydrologic cycle constantly redistributes water, evaporating from large bodies of water, precipitating onto land, becoming stored in groundwater, Plants, and animals, and returning to lakes, rivers, and oceans.

However, there is an unevern distribution of water resources across the globe. Tropics, along the equator tend to have the highest rainfall, while polar regions get the least rain

Nearly all of the world water is in the oceans, and the remaining fresh water is mostly contained in glaciers. Only about 0.02 percent of water is in a form accessible to humans and other organisms. 

## Groundwater Zones
Precipitation persolates through the soil, eventually saturating it completely deep in the ground. this is known as groundwater, and makes up much of the drinkable freshwater that humans use. 
### Zone of Aeration 
Shallow layer of soil containing both air and water

### Zone of Saturation
Lower soil layer with pores filled with water

### Aquifer
The bulk of a groundwater saturation zone
### Water Table
top of zone of saturation that supplies most wells


# Where is water concentrated?
## Rivers
the 16 largest rivers on earth carry nearly half of the worlds surface runoff, and of that half, the Amazon carries as much water as the next 7 largest rivers combined.

## Wetlands
Bogs, Swamps, and Marshes play a vital role in the hydrologic cycle

## Lakes 
lakes contain more than 100 times as much water as all rivers and streams combined, and most of this is again concentrated in the world's largest lakes

## The Atmosphere
the atmosphere contains only 0.001% of the worlds water supply in the form of water vapor, but is vital for the redistribution of water across the world.

# How much Water do we use?
Although water is a renewable resource, renewal takes time, especially in areas with low rates of precipitation(Arizona) if the rate of water use exceeds the rate of renewal, lakes and aquifers can become exhausted.

## Depletion of groundwater
Currently, groundwater provides about 40% of America's fresh water for agricultural and domestic use

In many areas of the US, especially the southwest, groundwater is being depleted faster than natural recharge can replace it. heavy water withdrawal can also cause aquifers to collapse, creating subsidence and sinkholes.

This can lead to saltwater intrusion eventually, permanently destroying the drinkable portion of the aquifer.

# What do we use water for?
Some European countries use ~70% of water for heavy industry, with cooling water for power plants taking up most of that use. 


# Water Scarcity
The WHO considers an average of 264000 gallons per person per year to be a nessecary amount of water use for domestic, industrial and agricultural uses. 

About a third of the worlds countries fall below this limit, especially poorer countries with more arid climates.

# Droughts
an extended period of consistently below average precipitation that has a substantial impact on ecosystems, agriculture, and economics. 

droughts are often cyclical, and land use practices can exacerbate their effects.

## How long can droughts last?
The dust bowl only lasted 6 years, but megadroughts can last for 25 to 50 years, destroying civilizations

# Water Conservation and Management
Watershed management and conservation are effective and environmentally sound ways to prevent flood damage and store water for future use, instead of building large dams

## What is a watershed
A watershed, or catchment, is all the land drained by a stream or river

Philadelphia sits in the Delaware River Watershed.

retaining vegetation and groundcover in a watershed helps hold back rainwater and lessens floods downstream. 

# Pollution
any physical, biological, or chemical change in water quality that adversely effects living organisms can be considered pollution

## Sources of pollution

**Point Sources** - A source of pollution that can be readily identified(Sewage drain, industrial water dump pipeline, Coal mines, oil wells, etc)
**Nonpoint Sources** - A source of pollution with on one identifiable source, usually dispersed over a wide area (Runoff from Agricultural Roads and parking lots, Logging areas, etc.)

## Biological Pollution
Pathogens from high concentrations of biological waste(sewage) can make water unsafe for consumption, carrying waterborne diseases like polio, cholera, and dysentery.

Eutrophication of water can encourage algal blooms, which contain high amounts of cyanobacteria, which can kill other orgainsms living in the water, as well as make it unsafe for use and consumption. 

## Chemical Pollution
Metals, Salts, and Acids common in industrial waste can devestate ecosystems when released into a water supply. 

## Thermal Pollution
Effluent from power plants and other industrial uses can raise the temperature of water in the surrounding area outside of the ideal temperatures for native organisms.
