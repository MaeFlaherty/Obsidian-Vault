# water as a natural resource
The Hydrologic cycle constantly redistributes water, evaporating from large bodies of water, precipitating onto land, becoming stored in groundwater, Plants, and animals, and returning to lakes, rivers, and oceans.

However, there is an unevern distribution of water resources across the globe. Tropics, along the equator tend to have the highest rainfall, while polar regions get the least rain

Nearly all of the world water is in the oceans, and the remaining fresh water is mostly contained in glaciers. Only about 0.02 percent of water is in a form accessible to humans and other organisms.
