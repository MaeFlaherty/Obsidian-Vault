# water as a natural resource
The Hydrologic cycle constantly redistributes water, evaporating from large bodies of water, precipitating onto land, becoming stored in groundwater, Plants, and animals, and returning to lakes, rivers, and oceans.

However, there is an unevern distribution of water resources across the globe. Tropics, along the equator tend to have the highest rainfall, while polar regions get the least rain

Nearly all of the world water is in the oceans, and the remaining fresh water is mostly contained in glaciers. Only about 0.02 percent of water is in a form accessible to humans and other organisms. 

## Groundwater Zones
Precipitation persolates through the soil, eventually saturating it completely deep in the ground. this is known as groundwater, and makes up much of the drinkable freshwater that humans use. 
### Zone of Aeration 
Shallow layer of soil containing both air and water

### Zone of Saturation
Lower soil layer with pores filled with water

### Aquifer
The bulk of a groundwater saturation zone
