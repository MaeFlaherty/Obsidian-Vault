### Definition
A Geometric Series is a [[Series and Sequences]] that takes the form 
$$
\sum^\infty_{k=1}ar^k
$$
---
#### Properties
When $r \geq 1$, the series **Diverges** 
 When $r < 1$, the series **Converges** to the sum
$$
\frac{a}{1-r}
$$

These can take a few different forms, and sometimes a series is not given explicitly in the above form(Like this failed quiz question)

 **Ex)** Determine if the given series converges or diverges. If it converges, find its sum
$$
2 - \frac{2}{3}+\frac{2}{9}-\frac{2}{27}+\frac{2}{81}
$$
The sequence can be written as
$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{2}{3^n}
$$
OR
$$
\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2*(-\frac{1}{3})^{n-1}
$$
This is a geometric series, and $r = -\frac{1}{3}<1$, so the series converges to
$$
\frac{2}{1+\frac{1}{3}}
$$
