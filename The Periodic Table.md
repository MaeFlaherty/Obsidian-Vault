# The Periodic Table
![[PeriodicTableWallpaper-56a12d103df78cf7726827e8.png]]
Created by Dimitri Mendeleev to explain a number of observations about the properties of atoms. 
# The Periodic Law
When the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, certain sets of properties appear periodically. 

# Structure of the Periodic Table(Periodic Properties)
## Density
Density increases as you move down a column 
	For example, aluminum is one of the least dense metals and is found near the top of the periodic table, while platinum is near the bottom and is one of the densest metals

## Mass
Mass increases as you move right on a row

Elements with similar properties fall in the same vertical columns

## Main Group Elements
Main Group Element columns are labeled with A(1, 2, 13-18)
- Predictable Properties based on periodic columns
## Transition Elements & Inner Transition Elements
Transition Columns are Labeled with B(3-12)
- Less predictable based on columns
