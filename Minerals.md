# Atoms, Elements, and Minerals

Atoms fuse together through [[Chemical Bonds]]. When This happens in the natural world, these bonded elements can form unique crystalline structures known as **Minerals**.

## What is a Mineral?

- Naturally Occurring (Must be found in nature)
- Solid at room temperature(Except for Ice)
- Abiogenic(Not made **only** by living organisms) - many minerals **can** be biogenic, but that is not their only source. 
- Definite Chemical Composition - All specimens share the same physical and chemical properties. 
- Crystalline Structure - a solid and symmetrical atomic order(solids without this structure can be glasses, resins, or plastics)

## Identifying Minerals

### Crystal Habit
- arrangement of faces reflects internal atomic structure
- if a crystal forms unrestricted, it develops natural crystal faces and assumes a distinct geometric form
	Habits include asbestiform(needle-like), cubic, bladed, and others
### Cleavage or Fracture
how a mineral breaks can help identify a mineral
minerals will be weaker along certain planes, due to how their crystalline bonds form. This is known as the **Cleavage Plane**

Some minerals have no cleavage planes, and when they break, they will instead fracture. these fractures can be conchoidal, irregular, or crystalline.
### Specific gravity
represents the density of a mineral because minerals share the same chemical properties, their density can help you differentiate them. 
### Hardness
hardness is the scratching resistance of a mineral, which derives from the strength of atomic bonds. this is commonly measured using the [[Mohs Hardness Scale]]

### Luster 
The way a mineral scatters light on it's surface. 

luster can be **metallic** or **nonmetallic**

nonmetallic types
- Silky
- Vitreous
- Satiny
- resinous
- Pearly
- Earthy 
- Adamantine(diamond)
### Color 
color varieties can reflect trace impurities, but is diagnostic for some minerals
### Streak 
The color of powder when crushing a mineral. 

streak is collected by scraping the mineral on unglazed porcelain.
### Special Properties
Some minerals have unique chemical properties, such as smell, reaction to acid, magnetism, taste, feel, fluorescence
### Synthetic Minerals
Humans can recreate minerals that occur in nature, known as synthetic minerals, like in a diamond anvil press, used to recreate the conditions in the earth's mantle.

## Mineral Nomenclature
Minerals can be separated by
1. the principle anion
2. anionic group
actual mineral structures are dependent on sizes of ions
only about 50 minerals are abundant. 

### Oxides($O^{2-}$)
Metal Cations bonded to oxygen
- magnetite
- hematite 
- rutile

### Sulfides($S^-$)
Metal cations bonded to a sulfide anion
- pyrite
- galena
- sphalerite
### Sulfates($SO_4^{2-}$)
Metal Cation bonded to sulfate anionic group
form by evapooration of seawater

- gypsum
- anhydrite

### Halides($Cl-$ or $Fl-$)
- flourite
- Halite(table salt)
### Carbonates($CO_3^{2-}$)
$$CO_3^{2-}$$
Made from precipitation
- calcite
- dolomite
### Native elements(Cu, Ag, Au)
Pure masses of a single meta
- Copper
- gold
- silver

### Silicates($SiO_4^{4-}$)
made of silicon and oxygen($SiO_4^{4-}$)
Known as the rock forming minerals
makes up the entire crust and mantle of the earth
the most common mineral
- Quartz
- 
All silicates contain the silicate tetrahedron, which can bond to a number of elements to produce rock-forming silicates
