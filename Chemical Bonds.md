## Chemical Bonds
Atoms will give up or gain an extra electron to have a stable outer ring. this creates 
Cations(+)
Anions(-)

### Ionic Bonds
the atoms are attracted to each other, when one is negatively charged and one is positively charged
### Covalent Bonds
The atoms share electrons, forming a very strong and stable bonded structure
#### Example
The covalent bond of Si and O forms silicate minerals, the most common type of mineral on earth. 

### Metallic Bonds
the electrons are bonded together with electrons still free-flowing, allowing a for a stable but malleable substance. gold or steel working uses these properties.
