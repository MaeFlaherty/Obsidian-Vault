# What is a Rock?
A rock is a coherent, naturally occurring slid consisting of an aggregate of [[Minerals]]
- Coherent
- Naturally Occurring
- Aggregate of Minerals
Crystals can grow together in a solid form to become rocks

## How are the Minerals held together?
**Clastic Rocks** are made of crystalline grains held together by a 'cement', a medium that holds many smaller mineral crystals together.

cement can be carbonate, silicate, iron based, or a number of other types.

**Crystalline Rocks** are heated together until different mineral crystals fuse together, then cool, becoming a single mass.
## Types of Rocks
### Sedimentary rocks
cementing together rock fragments by precipitation of mineral crystals out of water solutions, eg. in a riverbed over thousands of years

### Igneous Rocks
Form by the solidification of molten rock

### Metamorphic Rock
Formed when preexisting rock is exposed to Heat or Pressure




# The Rock Cycle
## How are Rocks Formed?




# Magma and Igneous Processes

# Rock Formations
Bedrock is rock that is still attached to the earth's crust.
a **Rock Outcropping** is a piece of bedrock that can be observed on the earth's surface.
