# What is a Rock?
A rock is a coherent, naturally occurring slid consisting of an aggregate of [[Minerals]]
- Coherent
- Naturally Occurring
- Aggregate of Minerals
Crystals can grow together in a solid form to become rocks

## How are the Minerals held together?
**Clastic Rocks** are made of crystalline grains held together by a 'cement', a medium that holds many smaller mineral crystals together.

cement can be carbonate, silicate, iron based, or a number of other types.

**Crystalline Rocks** are heated together until different mineral crystals fuse together, then cool, becoming a single mass.
## Types of Rocks
### Sedimentary rocks
cementing together rock fragments by precipitation of mineral crystals out of water solutions, eg. in a riverbed over thousands of years.

Sedimentary rocks form at passive margins, ocean shores where no subduction is occurring. Sediment from the ocean is deposited on the shore, where further layers are deposited on top, eventually compacting into sedimentary rock.

Sedimentary rock can also be formed from erosion. as wind and water wears away at existing rocks and rock outcroppings, eventually collecting the sediment and transforming it into sedimentary rock. 

### Igneous Rocks
Form by the solidification of molten rock

Igneous rocks form from mid ocean ridges and continental volcanos, with magma pushing up through the crust, erupting out of a volcano, and eventually cooling and solidifying into Igneous Rock. 

### Metamorphic Rock
Formed when preexisting rock is exposed to Heat or Pressure

Metamorphic rocks are formed at continental plate barriers, where energy from the collision or divergence of plates stressed the rock, exposing it to heat and pressure, causing the rock that is already there to recrystallize into different types of rock.

## How are Rocks Formed?
### Erosion
Rock formations break off pieces over time, from wind, rain, or other reasons. these smaller particles can sometimes collect into sediment and form sedimentary rocks

### Deposition
The deposition of sand in bodies of water creates many layers of sediment. These layers compact over time to create sedimentary rocks.

### Eruption
Magma from the mantle comes up to the surface at mid ocean ridges and volcanoes, and then cools, forming igneous rocks.

### Pressure
Forces at Continental plate boundaries, or sufficient depth in the earth's crust can put large amounts of heat and pressure on rocks, cansing the formation of metamorphic rocks




# Magma and Igneous Processes

# Rock Formations
Bedrock is rock that is still attached to the earth's crust.
a **Rock Outcropping** is a piece of bedrock that can be observed on the earth's surface.
